total_time: "38 minutes"




ingredients:
  - "1/2 cup dried bread crumbs"
  - "1 tsp dried oregano"
  - "1/2 tsp dried thyme"
  - "1 tsp salt"
  - "1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper"
  - "16 ounces soft or firm tofu"
  - "1 1/2 cups canola oil"
  - "1/2 cup olive oil"
  - "2 large eggs, beaten"
  - "Honey Mustard (see recipe below)"

steps:
  - "Toast the bread crumbs in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring often until they are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Mix in the oregano, thyme, salt and pepper."
  - "Cut the block of tofu horizontally in half. Then cut it in half the long way. Make 5 cuts perpendicular to the long cut, creating 24 pieces. Cover a sheet pan with paper towels. Place the tofu in one layer on the towels. Blot the tofu, pressing it gently with additional towels to remove excess moisture."
  - "Heat the oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F. Cover a second baking sheet with more paper towels. Place the beaten eggs in a wide, shallow dish."
  - "Dip the tofu in the egg. Dredge the pieces in the bread crumb mixture until completely coated. Slip the breaded tofu into the hot oil, 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from pan using a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels."
