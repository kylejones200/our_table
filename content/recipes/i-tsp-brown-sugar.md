  - "Mix all ingredients for marinade in bowl, whisk. Place mushrooms in 13x9 pan, pour marinade over mushrooms and let them marinate for 1-2 hours or overnight. Mushroom will absorb most of the liquid. Grill or broil 5-8 minutes per side, cook until tender. Remove, slice and serve on a bed of gourmet greens, pouring vinaigrette over salad, and garnishing with goat's cheese."
