steps:
  - "Combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-sized bits. Sprinkle in ice water and stir just until the dough comes together. Shape into a disk, wrap, and chill at least 1 hour."
  - "Heat the oven to 375°F. Roll dough into a 12-inch circle and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim and crimp edges. Line with foil, fill with pie weights, and bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake 7 minutes more. Cool on a rack while preparing the filling."
  - "Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Toast pecans on a baking sheet 6 minutes, until fragrant. Brown the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the foam subsides and brown flecks appear. Remove from heat, add water, and cook 1 minute. Stir in the chocolate and let melt 3 minutes, then whisk smooth."
  - "In a bowl, whisk eggs and brown sugar until frothy. Slowly pour in the warm chocolate mixture while whisking. Stir in bourbon and vanilla."
  - "Scatter toasted pecans in the cooled crust and pour the filling over top. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, until the center is just set and slightly wobbly. Cool at least 2 hours before slicing."
