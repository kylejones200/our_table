--- Crust ---"
  - "11/2 cups all-purpose flour"
  - "2 tsp granulated sugar"
  - "1 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 tsp baking powder"
  - "1/2 cup butter cut into small pieces"
  - "1/4 cup ice water"
  - "--- Filling ---"
  - "2 cups pecans"
  - "1/4 cup salted butter"
  - "1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate (chopped into small pieces or use bittersweet chocolate chips)"
  - "3/4 cup water"
  - "3 eggs"
  - "11/2 cup brown sugar"
  - "11/2 Tbsp bourbon or whiskey"
  - "1 Tbsp vanilla extract"
steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 375F. Mix flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl."
  - "Add cold butter and cut into flour with two forks, a pastry cutter, or your fingers until the flour resembles cornmeal. (Note: be careful not to over mix the butter-small chunks of butter will make the crust flaky. You should be able to see streaks of butter in an unbaked pie crust.) Add ice water and knead dough until it just comes together in a semi-cohesive ball. Do not overwork it or the crust will become tough. Flatten into a thin round of dough and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. If you would like to make the dough in advance, it will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days before being used. Partially pre-bake pie crust by covering the pie crust with foil and weigh down with pie weights. Cook for 15 minutes with foil. Remove from oven and remove foil and pie weights. Put the pie back in the oven for 7 more minutes. Remove from oven and let cool."
  - "Reduce temperature to 350F. Put pecans on a small baking sheet and toast in the oven for 6 minutes or until fragrant. Brown the butter over medium-high heat in a small saucepan stirring constantly. You will know the butter is browned when the foam from cooking subsides and there are small brown speckles on the bottom of the pan (Note: if there are black speckles, you have cooked it for too long). When the butter is browned, add the water and cook for a minute longer until water is hot, but not boiling. Remove the pan from the stove and add the bittersweet chocolate. Let the chocolate sit in the water/butter mixture to melt for 3-4 minutes. Whisk the mixture together until smooth. In the meantime, mix the eggs, and brown sugar in bowl until frothy."
  - "Slowly pour the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, stirring vigorously. Mix in the bourbon and vanilla until fully blended."
  - "Place the pecans into the bottom of the partially pre-baked pie shell then pour in the filling mixture. Bake the pie for 40 minutes or until the center of the pie is semi-firm and no long wiggles when the pie is moved."
  - "Let it cool for at least 2 hours before cutting into the pie. Note: For a more golden crust, brush an egg wash on the crust about 15 minutes before it is done baking. You can make this pie a day in advance."
