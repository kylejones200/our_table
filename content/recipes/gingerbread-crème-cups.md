description: ""
yield: "24 servings"
categories:
  - "dessert"
source: ""
ingredients:
  - "1 (30 oz) package Pillsbury Gingerbread Cookie Dough"
  - "8 ounces reduced fat (Neufachtel) cream cheese, softened"
  - "1 cup powdered sugar"
  - "1 tsp vanilla"
steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a mini-miffin tin with cooking spray (or line with paper liners)."
  - "Scoop level Tbsp of dough, roll into balls, and place in sprayed tin. Bake 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately use the handle of a wooden spoon to make an indentation in the center of each cookie cup. (Do not poke all the way through to bottom.) Remove from muffin tins and cool completely."
  - "Beat cream cheese with powdered sugar. Stir in vanilla. Place filling into a piping bag, cut off edge of bag. Pipe one tsp or so of filling into each area of cookie dough. (I used Wilton tip 2D to pipe these…it's available at any craft store.)"
notes: "If you are really short on time, skip the homemade creme filling and pipe in a prepackaged cream cheese frosting. (Yep, I've had to do this before.) If you have a little leftover cookie dough, bake it and then crumble to sprinkle on top!"
