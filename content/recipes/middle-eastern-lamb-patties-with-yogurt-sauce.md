  - "Mix in the lamb, cilantro, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne until evenly combined. Divide into 12 portions, rolling each into a ball and then flattening into patties about 1/2 inch thick."
  - "Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Brown the patties on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil."
  - "For the yogurt sauce, stir together the yogurt, cilantro, lemon juice, garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper."
  - "Serve the patties warm with the yogurt sauce spooned over top or alongside."
