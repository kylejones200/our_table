--- Beans ---"
  - "41/2 cups (2lb/1 kg) canned white beans, rinsed and drained"
  - "11/2 cups (9 oz/280 g) diced fresh tomatoes or canned diced tomatoes, drained"
  - "1 small onion, finely chopped"
  - "1 1/2 tsp choppe fresh rosemary or 1/2 tsp dried rosemary"
  - "3 garlic cloves, minced"
  - "3/4 tsp ground pepper"
  - "6 small rosemary sprigs"
steps:
  - "In a small bowl, combine the rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. Rub the mixture evenly into both sides of lamb chops. Cover and marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the beans, preheat an oven to 425 degrees (220 Celsius). Coat a 2-qt (2-1) shallow baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the beans, tomatoes, onion, parsley, rosemary, garlic and pepper."
  - "Spread the bean mixture into the prepared dish. Cover and bake until heated through, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a broiler (griller). Arrange lamb chops on a broiler pan and place the pan 4 inches (10 cm) from the heat. Broil, turning once, until lightly browned on both sides, 6-7 minutes total."
  - "Remove the dish from the oven and arrange the lamb chops on top of the beans, pressing down gently. Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, until the beans are lightly browned on top and the cops are fully cooked, about 10 minutes. To serve, divide the beans and lamb chops among individual plates. Garnish the rosemary sprigs."
notes: "One lamb cop is a perfect little package of red meat served with well-seasoned white beans in a robust and satisfying entr√©e. To round out the meal, serve a green vegetable side. *Do NOT overcook the lamb; it can and should be enjoyed rare. No blood means tough, tasteless meat."
