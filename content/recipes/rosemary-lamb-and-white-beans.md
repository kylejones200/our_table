steps:
  - "Stir the rosemary, crushed garlic, and olive oil together and rub all over both sides of the lamb chops. Cover and let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes."
  - "Heat the oven to 425°F and lightly coat a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Toss the beans, tomatoes, onion, parsley, rosemary, minced garlic, and pepper together, then spread in the dish. Cover and bake 15 minutes."
  - "Meanwhile, preheat a broiler. Arrange the lamb chops on a broiler pan and broil 4 inches from the heat, turning once, until lightly browned, about 6 to 7 minutes total."
  - "Nestle the lamb chops into the beans, pressing gently. Return the dish to the oven and bake, uncovered, about 10 minutes, until the beans are lightly browned on top and the lamb reaches desired doneness. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve."

notes: "Avoid overcooking the lamb—medium-rare keeps the meat tender. Add a green vegetable on the side for a complete meal."
