source: "Adapted from A Cozy Kitchen"
ingredients:
  - "1 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, room temperature"
  - "1/2 cup of granulated sugar"
  - "1 large egg"
  - "1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract"
  - "1 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour"
  - "1/8 tsp kosher salt"
  - "1/2 cup of granulated sugar"
  - "2 1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature"
  - "1/4 cup heavy whipping cream"
steps:
  - "Use an electric mixer to cream together the butter, sugar and egg. Add vanilla. Separately, sift together the flour and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture. Mix just until the dough comes together. Refrigerate for 1 hour, up to overnight."
  - "Scoop level Tbsp of dough and roll into balls."
  - "Place on a silpat or parchment-lined cookie sheet. Hold the cookie steady with one hand and press a light indentation into the top of each with your finger. (I like a pretty big indentation because, let's face it, the caramel is the best part.) Bake at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes, until they're barely golden on the sides. Remove from oven and immediately re-poke your thumbprints if they've faded. (You can use the tip of a wooden spoon if too hot.) Let them cool. While they're cooling, make the caramel."
  - "Combine the sugar and 2 Tbsp water in a medium saucepan (high sides). Do not stir. Cook over medium-high heat to a dark caramel color, swirling as it begins to brown to distribute the sugar. While the sugar and water are going at it, heat up the cream in a saucepan or microwave just until warm. Take off the heat and add your room temperature butter. Whisk the butter in, being sure it's totally combined. Add your warmed cream and whisk vigorously. Mixture will bubble, then settle down to a velvety caramel. By now your cookies should be cooled. Spoon as much warm caramel as you can into the indentations of your cookies and top with sea salt. You may have a bit of caramel left over. Drink it before anyone finds out."
notes: "You can cheat and use storebought caramel, but please use the good stuff. I included the recipe for homemade belowâ€¦it's the most foolproof I've found."
