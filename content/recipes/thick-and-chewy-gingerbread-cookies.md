ingredients:
  - "3 cups (15 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour"
  - "3/4 cup (5.25 ounces) dark brown sugar"
  - "3/4 tsp baking soda"
  - "1 Tbsp ground cinnamon"
  - "1 Tbsp ground ginger"
  - "1/2 tsp ground cloves"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "12 Tbsp (1 1/2 sticks or 6 ounces) unsalted butter, softened but still cool, cut into 12 pieces"
  - "3/4 cup molasses"
  - "2 Tbsp milk"
steps:
  - "In a food processor, process the flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt until combined, about 10 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture and process until the mixture is sandy and resembles very fine meal, about 15 seconds. With the machine running, gradually add the molasses and milk; process until the dough is evenly moistened and forms a soft mass, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, with an electric mixer, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt at a low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and add the butter pieces; mix at medium-low speed until mixture is sandy and resembles fine meal, about 11/2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and, with the mixer running, gradually add the molasses and milk; mix until the dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase the speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds. Scrape the dough onto a work surface; divide it in half. Working with one portion at a time, roll the dough 1/4 inch thick between 2 large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving the dough sandwiched between the parchment layers, stack on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate the dough 2 hours or overnight). Adjust the oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray them with nonstick cooking spray."
  - "Remove 1 dough sheet from the freezer, place on the work surface. Peel off the top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip the dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut the dough into 5-inche gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread cookies, transferring shapes to prepared baking sheets with a wide metal spatula, spacing them 1 inch apart; set the scraps aside. Repeat with the remaining dough until the baking sheets are full. Bake the cookies until set in the centers and the dough barely retains an imprint when touched very gently with a fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes, rotating the baking sheets front to back and switching positions top to bottom halfway through the baking time. Do not overbake. Cool the cookies on the sheets 2 minutes, then remove the cookies with a wide metal spatula to a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Gather the scraps; repeat rolling, cutting, and baking in steps 2 and 4. Simple Icing: Start with 2 cups of powdered (aka confectioners or icing) sugar. Sift (not necessary but mixes more easily) powdered sugar with 1 tsp of vanilla. Slowly add cream or milk until a thick paste, a little runnier than peanut butter, forms. Spoon into a ziplock bag, and twist the open top to squeeze icing to one corner. Cut a small hole off of the corner. Continue to twist and squeeze from the top part of the bag."
notes: "Because flour is not added during rolling, dough scraps can be rolled and cut as many times as necessary. Don't overbake the cookies or they will be dry. Store soft gingerbread in a wide, shallow airtight container or tin with sheet of parchment or waxed paper between cookie layers. These cookies are best eaten within 1 week."
