ingredients:
  - "1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling"
  - "6 ounces pancetta, chopped fine"
  - "1 large onion, minced"
  - "2 medium celery ribs, chopped fine"
  - "1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped fine"
  - "7 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press"
  - "1 pound dried cannelli, great northern, or navy beans, sorted, soaked overnight and drained"

  - "1 cup water"
  - "1 (28 oz) can diced tomatoes, drained"
  - "2 bay leaves"
  - "1 sprig fresh rosemary"
notes: |
  If pancetta is too difficult to find, bacon may be substituted, though the flavor will not be quite the same. It should be sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. When purchasing dried beans, look for packages with whole, clean-looking beans; split beans and dust can be indicative of old age. Beans should be soaked for a minimum of eight hours and can be soaked for up to 24 hours (but for this length of time they should be stored in the refrigerator). Serve with a crusty loaf of bread or bruschetta and a leafy green salad.
  Planning Ahead: The stew may be prepared through step 1, then refrigerated for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 4 months. (Allow frozen stew to thaw completely in the refrigerator before reheating, to preserve the texture of the beans.) Bring the stew to a simmer over medium-low heat before continuing with step 2.
