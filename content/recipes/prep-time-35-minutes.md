ingredients:
  - "3 medium zucchini, cut into 1/4\"-thick lengthwise slices"
  - "2 large red bell peppers, cut into 1\"-wide strips"
  - "1 Tbsp olive oil"
  - "8 oz sliced mushrooms"
  - "4 medium carrots, coarsely shredded"
  - "10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry"
  - "15 oz reduced-fat ricotta cheese"
  - "1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
  - "1 large egg"
  - "26 oz jar of spaghetti sauce"
  - "9 no-boil lasagna noodles"
  - "1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese"
steps:
  - "Preheat the oven to 450F. Coat bottoms and sides of 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Arrange the zucchini and peppers on the baking sheets. Coat with cooking spray. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender, moving the sheets to the opposite oven racks once. Remove sheets and reduce the oven temperature to 350F."
  - "Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Stir in the carrots and cook for 1 minute longer. Set aside. In a medium bowl, stir the spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, and egg until blended. Notes: This can be served with additional pasta sauce to spoon over the top if desired. I used more than 9 lasagna noodles; enough to have solid leaves."
