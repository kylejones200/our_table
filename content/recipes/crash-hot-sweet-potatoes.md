--- Topping Mixture ---"
  - "1 1/2 Tbsp light brown sugar"
  - "1/2 tsp kosher salt"
  - "1/2 tsp ground cumin"
  - "1/2 tsp chili powder"
  - "1/2 tsp paprika"
  - "1/2 tsp onion powder"
  - "1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder"
  - "1/8 tsp garlic powder"
  - "10 grinds coarse black pepper"
steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 425 degrees and cover a baking sheet with foil."
  - "Peel the sweet potatoes and slice about 1 1/4 inches thick. Add 1/2 tsp salt to water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add potato slices and simmer for about 12 minutes, or until slightly softened. Remove carefully to a wire rack and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. While potatoes are cooling, add empty baking sheet to oven to heat."
  - "Blend the topping ingredients together well with a fork, making sure to incorporate the sugar completely. Using a flat bottomed bowl, slightly smash the cooled sweet potato slices onto the preheated, greased baking sheet, taking care that they stay intact. Drizzle each slice with a mixture of the butter and oil and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 of the topping mixture. Gently turn over each slice, drizzle with remaining butter/oil mixture and topping mixture. Avoid dropping the topping on the sheet between the sheets, because it will burn and smoke before the potatoes are done. Roast at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, carefully flip each slice and return to the oven for about 10 minutes more. Serve hot."
