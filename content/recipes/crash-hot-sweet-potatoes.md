Topping Mixture:
  - "1 1/2 Tbsp light brown sugar"
  - "1/2 tsp kosher salt"
  - "1/2 tsp ground cumin"
  - "1/2 tsp chili powder"
  - "1/2 tsp paprika"
  - "1/2 tsp onion powder"
  - "1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder"
  - "1/8 tsp garlic powder"
  - "10 grinds coarse black pepper"

steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 425°F and cover a baking sheet with foil."
  - "Peel the sweet potatoes and slice about 1 1/4 inches thick. Add 1/2 tsp salt to water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add potato slices and simmer for about 12 minutes, or until slightly softened. Remove carefully to a wire rack and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. While potatoes are cooling, add the empty baking sheet to the oven to heat. Blend the topping ingredients together with a fork. Using a flat-bottomed bowl, gently smash the cooled sweet potato slices onto the preheated, greased baking sheet. Drizzle each slice with the butter and oil mixture and sprinkle evenly with half of the topping. Turn each slice, drizzle with remaining butter/oil mixture, and finish with remaining topping. Roast at 425°F for 15 minutes, flip carefully, then roast about 10 minutes more. Serve hot."
