ingredients:
  - "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs"
notes: "Buttered egg noodles are our favorite accompaniment to this simple Hungarian stew. To keep the sour cream from curdling, make sure to stir some of the hot stew liquid into the sour cream before adding it to the pot. The dish of chick will be very hot coming out of the microwave-be sure to set it on a clean, dry surface or trivet, and be careful of hot steam when removing the plastic wrap."
