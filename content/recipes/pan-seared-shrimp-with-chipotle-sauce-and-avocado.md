ingredients:
  - "1 Tomato, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces"
  - "2 Scallions, white and green parts separated, each sliced thin"
  - "2 Tbsp Minced fresh cilantro"
  - "2 Garlic cloves, minced"
  - "1/2-1 tsp Minced canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce (see note)"
  - "Salt and Pepper"
  - "Pinch of sugar"
  - "12 oz Extra-large shrimp (21-25 per pound) peeled and deveined"
  - "4 tsp Vegetable oil"
  - "2 tsp Fresh lime juice"
  - "1/2 Ripe avocado, halved, pitted, and diced"
steps:
  - "Combine the tomato, scallion whites, cilantro, garlic, chipotle, 1/4 tsp salt, and a pinch of pepper in a bowl. In a separate bowl, toss the shrimp with the sugar, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper."
  - "Heat 1 Tbsp of the oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook, without moving, until spotty brown on one side, about 1 minute. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl (they will be underdone, unless working with pre-cooked shrimp)."
  - "Add the remaining tsp of oil to the skillet and return to high heat until just smoking. Add the tomato mixture and lime juice, and cook until the tomato softens slightly, about 1 minute. Return shrimp to the skillet and continue to cook until they are cooked through and hot, about 1 minute."
notes: "If your shrimp are smaller than 21 to 25 per pound, the cooking times will be even shorter. Serve with plain white rice (or basmati brown rice). For more heat, add the greater amount of Chipotle chile. We used precooked shrimp, well-drained, with definite shorter cooking period."
