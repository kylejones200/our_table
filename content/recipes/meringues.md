steps:
  - "Crème Anglaise: Bring the cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. When the cream reaches a simmer, reduce the heat to low. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the yolk mixture, then slowly whisk the tempered yolk mixture into the hot cream. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened (lightly coats the back of a spoon) and reached 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 minutes. Immediately pour the crème anglaise through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming, and set aside to cool at room temperature."
  - "Bring 11/2 inches (about 5 quarts) water to a simmer in a large roasting pan set over 2 burners over medium-high heat. Use a spoon to transfer the meringues to the water. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer the meringues until they are firm, about 4 minutes, flipping the over halfway through the cooking time. Meanwhile, ladle 1/2 cup of the cooled crème anglaise into 6 shallow soup bowls. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 2 meringues from the simmering water into each bowl. Drizzle the meringues with the remaining crème anglaise. Serve immediately."
