  - "--- peanut butter cookie dough ---"
  - "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature"
  - "1/2 cup light brown sugar (or dark brown)"
  - "1/4 cup sugar"
  - "1 large egg"
  - "3/4 cup creamy peanut butter"
  - "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "1/2 tsp baking soda"
  - "1 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (careful not to overmeasure)"
  - "1/4 tsp salt"
  - "1 cup dark chocolate chips (or semi-sweet or milk chocolate)"
  - "1. Cream the butter and sugars together with a hand or stand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom as needed."
  - "2. Beat in the egg and vanilla until combined, scraping down the sides as needed."
  - "3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Slowly mix it into the wet ingredients. The dough will be very thick."
  - "4. With a spoon or rubber spatula, mix in the milk and then fold in the chocolate chips."
  - "1. Cream the butter and sugars together with a hand or stand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom as needed."
  - "2. Mix in the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla (in that order). Scrape down the sides as needed."
  - "3. Slowly mix in the baking soda, flour, and salt. Do not overmix."
  - "4. Fold in the chocolate chips."
  - "5. Chill both doughs for at least 1-2 hours. 2 hours is preferred."
  - "6. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line cookie sheet with silicone baking mat or parchment paper."
  - "7. Measure 2 Tbsp of peanut butter cookie dough. Roll into a ball. Take 2 Tbsp of chocolate cookie dough. Roll into a ball. Smoosh the two balls together and roll them into 1 large ball. Repeat for each cookie."
  - "The chocolate cookie dough will get onto your hands, so roll out the peanut butter cookies first, and keep in refrigerator until you have then made all of the chocolate balls. It is important the chocolate cookie dough is chilled or else it will be even messier."
  - "8. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes, not exceeding 13 minutes. The cookies will look very soft, puffy, and almost undone. Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet and they will continue to \"bake\" and set up. Sometimes I press a few more chocolate chips into the top of the cookies when they are still warm, for looks. As the cookies cool, they will firm up. Cookies remain fresh (and soft) for up to 10 days in an airtight container."
