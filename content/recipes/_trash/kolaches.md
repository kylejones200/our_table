steps:
  - "Use the bread recipe for Rohlickes. When bread is rising, prepare filling for Kolaches. For apricot filling, use 1 package dried apricots & one package dried peaches. I usually chop the dried fruit in the food processor, then put in saucepan and cover with water, just barely. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, watching so they don't scorch. Add more water if needed. You want a kind of jam-like consistency for the filling. Stir in 1 cup sugar, taste, and add more if needed. Cool filling. After punching dough down, pinch dough off into 11/4 inch balls, put on greased cookie sheet. Make a depression in the center. Put in warm dishwasher to rise. After pan of rolls have risen about 30 minutes, go back and widen the depression with your fingers, so that a Tbsp of filling will fit in. Let the pan rise an additional 30 minutes. Fill the depression with filling, being careful not to get the filling all over the top of the bread. Make the crumb topping by mixing together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and about 2-3 Tbsp butter. Mix until crumbly, and put about a tsp on top of filling of each kolache, then bake for 9-11 minutes at 350Â°. Brush with melted butter. Makes 3 dozen. Julia Kastl"
