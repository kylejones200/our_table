  - "Cover and let rise in a warm place (85Â°), free from drafts 1 hour or until dough is doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and stir in remaining flour, butter, and 1/4 cup chopped rosemary. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 10 minutes. Divide dough into thirds; roll each portion into a 9 inch circle on baking sheets coated with cooking spray."
