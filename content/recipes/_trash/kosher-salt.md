steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 400˚F and line a cookie sheet with foil for easy clean up. Stack and cut tortillas into strips."
  - "Place strips on cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp of olive oil."
  - "Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and toss lightly with your hands until all strips are coated with oil."
  - "Spread out into a single layer."
  - "Bake for 10 minutes then remove from oven and toss with a spatula. Redistribute to an even layer and return to oven."
  - "Repeat until strips are golden and crispy (20-30 minutes). Toppings • crispy tortilla strips • thinly sliced green onions • coarsely chopped cilantro • diced avocado For the soup, stack the corn tortillas on top of each other. Cut into 1/4-inch thick strips, widthwise. In a blender or food processor blend 1 celery stalk with 1/2 cup of corn. In a large heavy-duty soup pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until onions are translucent and tender. Add cilantro, garlic, oregano, chili powder, and smoked paprika and sauté another minute or two."
  - "Add corn tortilla strips and sauté for another two minutes or until softened."
  - "Add tomatoes, chicken broth and celery/corn mixture to pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered for 45 minutes, maintaining a steady simmer. (Tortilla strips will melt into the broth.)"
  - "Add chicken and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add lime juice. Taste and add a freshly ground black pepper and salt as needed."
  - "Serve soup topped with tortilla strips, sliced green onion, chopped, fresh cilantro, diced avocado and lime wedges."
