steps:
  - "Arrange chopped lettuce on a platter. Trim a thin slice of orange skin down to the flesh off the top and bottom of the orange. Stand the orange upright and trim off strips of the remaining peel working from top to bottom around the orange. Cut each orange then in 1/2 lengthwise. Slice the 1/2 oranges into 1/2 moon shapes. Arrange the sliced oranges around the chopped romaine. Lightly toast the almonds in a small skillet over moderate heat or in a toaster or conventional oven. Top the romaine and oranges with toasted almonds and chopped tarragon. In a small bowl, combine honey, vinegar, orange juice and mustard with a whisk. Stream in the oil while continuing to whisk the dressing to combine it. Pour the dressing evenly over the entire salad platter in a slow, thin stream. Season the salad with salt and pepper. The salad is pretty as is, no tossing."
