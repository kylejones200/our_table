source: "The Best New Recipes 2004"
ingredients:
  - "6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped coarse"
  - "4 Tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter"
  - "Pinch salt"
  - "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "2 Tbsp strong coffee or 4 tsp brandy, orange-flavored liqueur, or light rum"
  - "4 large eggs, separated"
  - "2 Tbsp sugar"
  - "1. Melt the chocolate in a medium bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water or in an uncovered Pyrex measuring cup microwaved at 50 percent power for 3 minutes, stirring once at the 2-minute mark. Whisk the butter into the melted chocolate, 1 Tbsp at a time. Stir in the salt, vanilla, and coffee until completely incorporated. Whisk in the yolks, one at a time, making sure that each is fully incorporated before adding the next; set the mixture aside."
  - "2. Stir the egg whites in a clean mixing bowl set over a saucepan of hot water until slightly warm, 1 to 2 minutes; remove the bowl from the saucepan. Beat with an electric mixer set at medium speed until soft peaks form. Raise the mixer speed to high and slowly add the sugar; beat to soft peaks. Whisk a quarter of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining whites."
notes: "For an extra-creamy chocolate mousse, fold in 1 cup of heavy cream that's been whipped (instead of the 1/2 cup called for below). Make this mousse at least 2 hours before you wish to serve it to let the flavors develop, but serve it within 24 hours because the flavor and texture will begin to deteriorate."
