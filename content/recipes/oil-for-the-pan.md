steps:
  - "Bring the sugar, dark brown sugar, cream, milk, corn syrup, and salt to a boil over medium heat in a 3-quart saucepan. Boil to 242°F, stirring frequently."
  - "Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla, and flour. (Try to get as many of those flour lumps out as you can.) Pour the mixture into a 9 x 13-inch baking pan in a thin layer. Let cool to 110°F undisturbed, about 20 minutes. (My note: I did not measure temp but 20 minutes was way too long for me…the mixture was very hard to scrape out. 10 minutes worked like a charm. Use a spoon to scrape it right out of the pan.) Scrape the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer."
  - "Mix on medium speed with a paddle attachment until the fudge thickens and begins to hold its shape, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape into the prepared 8 x 8-inch baking pan, and spread evenly with an offset spatula. (I only have 9-inch pans, and I like my fudge a little thicker, so you can see I didn't use the whole pan.) Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top, then lightly press them into the fudge. Let cool and set, at least 2 hours. Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes if the chocolate chips are still soft."
  - "Cut into pieces of desired size, and store in an airtight container. Fudge is even better on day two!"
