ingredients:
  - "2 cups almonds, toasted and chopped"
  - "2 sticks butter (no substitute)"
  - "1 cup sugar"
  - "3 Tbsp Cold water"
  - "11 oz. milk chocolate bars"
steps:
  - "Toast almonds in microwave on HIGH for 1 minute intervals, until toasted. Chop, set aside."
  - "Combine butter, sugar and water in heavy saucepan – bring to boil over medium heat – boil stirring occasionally 3-4 minutes. Put lid on pan, boil 3 minutes. (Putting the lid on for 3 minutes melts any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan that could ruin your toffee. Very important step.)Remove lid and continue to cook to 290° (soft crack), stirring more frequently when mixture begins to turn caramel color. Pour candy onto foil-covered jelly roll pan. Arrange (evenly) chocolate squares on top of hot candy. Spread when melted. Sprinkle nuts on top, press in with hands. Place in refrigerator for 30 minutes to set chocolate. Remove and break into pieces. Store in airtight container."
