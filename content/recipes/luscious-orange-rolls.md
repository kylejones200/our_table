steps:
  - "Dissolve yeast in warm water and let stand 5 minutes. In a small saucepan, heat sour cream, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt just until warm, then stir into the yeast mixture. Add melted butter, eggs, and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Gradually add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough."
  - "Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour."
  - "Punch down the dough and roll into a 12×16-inch rectangle. Spread with softened butter. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with orange zest and sprinkle evenly over the dough."
  - "Roll up tightly starting from a long side and pinch the seam to seal. Slice into 12 even rolls and arrange in a greased 9×13-inch baking dish. Cover and let rise until puffy, 30 to 40 minutes. Heat the oven to 375°F."
  - "Bake the rolls until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer glaze ingredients in a small saucepan, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Spoon glaze over warm rolls and serve."
