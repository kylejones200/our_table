steps:
  - "Put the morels in a strainer and rinse well under cold running water, shaking to remove as much sand as possible. Put them in a pan with the stock and bring to the boil over a medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to stand for 1 hour. Skip if using fresh or frozen mushrooms."
  - "Remove the morels from the cooking liquid and strain the liquid through a very fine sieve or muslin-lined strainer and reserve for the sauce. Reserve a few whole morels and slice the rest."
  - "Melt half the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for 2 minutes until softened, then add the morels and mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes. Season and add the thyme, brandy and 1/3 cup of the cream. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 minutes until any liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Remove the morel mixture from the pan and set aside. Pull the fillets (the finger-shaped pieced on the underside) off the chicken breast and reserve for another use. Make a pocket in each chicken breast by cutting a slit along the thicker edge, taking care not to cut all the way through. Using a small spoon, fill each pocket with one-quarter of the mushroom mixture then close with a toothpick if needed."
  - "Melt the remaining butter with the oil in a heavy frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook the chicken breasts on one side for 6-8 minutes until golden. Transfer the chicken breast to a plate. Add the Champagne or sparkling wine to the pan and boil to reduce by half. Add the strained morel cooking liquid and boil to reduce by half again."
  - "Add the remaining cream and cook over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning. Return the chicken to the pan with any accumulated juices and the reserved whole morels and simmer for 3-5 minutes over a medium-low heat until the chicken breasts are cooked through."
