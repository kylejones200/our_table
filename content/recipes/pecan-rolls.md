steps:
  - "Dissolve the yeast in warm water and let stand 5 minutes. Scald the cream in a saucepan, then stir in butter to melt along with sugar, eggs, and salt. When the mixture cools to lukewarm, add the yeast and 3 cups of the flour, stirring until smooth."
  - "Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead, adding only as much of the last cup of flour as needed, until smooth and satiny. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours."
  - "Combine the granulated sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, and chopped pecans for the filling. Melt the 1/2 cup butter for brushing. For the topping, divide the butter, corn syrup, and brown sugar evenly among four greased 8-inch round cake pans and stir to blend; scatter whole pecans over each pan."
  - "Punch down the dough and divide into four equal pieces. Roll each into a 12-inch square. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with one-quarter of the filling. Roll up tightly and cut each log into 8 slices."
  - "Arrange 8 slices in each prepared pan, cut sides down. Cover and let rise 45 minutes. Bake at 375°F for about 25 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Invert immediately onto racks or plates so the caramel topping coats the rolls."
