ingredients:
  - "2 cups all-purpose flour"
  - "1/2 cup shortening"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "4 Tbsp ice cold water -- use 3-4 tbls."
  - "5 Tbsp cornstarch"
  - "2 cups water, divided"
  - "1 cup sugar"
  - "1/4 tsp salt"
  - "3 egg yolks, slightly beaten"
  - "2 Tbsp butter or margarine"
  - "5 Tbsp lemon juice"
  - "2 tsp grated lemon rind"
  - "1 baked pie shell"
steps:
  - "For pie crust mix flour and salt. Cut in shortening using a fork until mixture is crumbly, and shortening is thoroughly incorporated in. Add water, 1 Tbsp at a time tossing lightly, until mixture forms a ball. Roll out into circle to fit into pie pan. Place dough in pan, being careful not to stretch the dough as you do. Crimp the edges, and prick the dough on the inside of the pan with a fork so the dough will not bubble up when baking. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Cool."
  - "Mix cornstarch with 1/2 cup water in double boiler. Blend in sugar and salt. Add rest of water, blend well and heat to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Cover and cook 10 minutes. Gradually pour over beaten egg yolks, stirring constantly. Cook 2 minutes in the double boiler. Remove from heat, add margarine, lemon juice and lemon peel. Mix well, cool for 30 minutes. Pour into baked pie shell. Top with meringue. Bake at 325 for 15 minutes. For meringue, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add sugar slowly, 1 Tbsp at a time. Will take about 5 minutes to beat. When spreading meringue on pie filling, be sure and seal up to the edges of the pie crust."
