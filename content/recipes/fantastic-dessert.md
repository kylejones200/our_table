Second Part:
  - "1/2 lb cream cheese, softened"
  - "1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed"
  - "1 cup powdered sugar"

Third Part:
  - "1 large package chocolate instant pudding mix"
  - "1 3/4 cups cold milk"

steps:
  - "Heat the oven to 375°F. Melt the butter and stir in powdered sugar, flour, and pecans until the mixture resembles damp sand. Press into an ungreased 9×13-inch baking pan and bake 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool completely."
  - "Beat the cream cheese until smooth. Fold in the whipped topping and powdered sugar. Spread evenly over the cooled crust."
  - "Whisk the pudding mix with cold milk for 2 minutes. Let stand until slightly thickened, then spread over the cream cheese layer. Chill at least 4 hours. Garnish with additional whipped topping and chopped pecans, if desired, before serving."
