ingredients:
  - "1 package active dry yeast"
  - "1/2 cup sugar"
  - "1/4 cup warm water"
  - "2 eggs"
  - "2 cups cream"
  - "11/2 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 cup butter"
  - "6 cups bread flour"
steps:
  - "Dissolve yeast in warm water. Scald cream, add butter to melt; add eggs, sugar, and salt. When cream has cooled to lukewarm, add yeast and three cups flour. Stir until smooth. Cover and let this sponge rise in a warm place 30 minutes. Then add fourth and fifth cups of flour. Turn dough out on floured board and work in as little as possible of the sixth cup of flour. Knead until smooth and satiny. Put in greased bowl and let rise 11/2 hours. Punch down. Using about a third of the dough, roll into circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut circle into 12 wedges using a pizza cutter. Individually roll each wedge thin, to about 1/8 inch thickness. Beginning at wide end of wedge, roll tightly to narrow end. Place roll on cookie sheet with the narrow end tucked underneath the roll (this keeps the roll from coming undone while it's rising), shaping into crescent shape. Beat one egg in a cup, and brush rolls with the egg. Sprinkle poppy seeds over the roll. Let rolls rise 45 minutes in warm dishwasher. Bake rolls 10 minutes at 350Â°. Brush with melted butter. This recipe can also be used for sweet rolls. Makes about 3 dozen. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE THE BUTTER AND CREAM - THAT WAS GRANDMA KASTL'S SECRET."
