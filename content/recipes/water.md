steps:
  - "Saut√© the onions in the 1 Tbsp butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until softened. Add potatoes and just enough water to cook, about 1 cup. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the milk, remaining butter, salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook over medium heat until hot; do not boil. With a potato masher, mash some of the potatoes right in the pot to slightly thicken the soup."
