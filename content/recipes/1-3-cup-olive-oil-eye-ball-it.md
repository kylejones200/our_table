Stand the orange upright and trim off strips of the remaining peel working from top to bottom around the orange. Cut each orange then in 1/2 lengthwise. Slice the 1/2 oranges into 1/2 moon shapes. Arrange the sliced oranges around the chopped romaine. Lightly toast the almonds in a small skillet over moderate heat or in a toaster or conventional oven. Top the romaine and oranges with toasted almonds and chopped tarragon. "
