ingredients:
  - "1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature"
  - "1/2 cup brown sugar"
  - "2 tsp vanilla"
  - "1 egg"
  - "4 ripe bananas, mashed"
  - "1 cup (white or pastry) whole wheat flour"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "11/2 tsp baking soda"
  - "2 cups oats"
  - "11/4 cups chopped almonds"
  - "1/2 cup chocolate chips"
  - "1/4 cup chia seeds (optional)"

steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cream together butter and brown sugar."
  - "Add vanilla, egg, and mashed bananas and mix well."
  - "Sift together flour, salt, and baking soda. Add to mixture and mix well."
  - "Stir in almonds, chocolate chips, and chia seeds (if using). Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop dough onto parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown, rotating halfway through."

notes: "Steel cut oats or quick cook oats work with this recipe, but each provides a different texture. If you can't find white or pastry whole wheat flour, you can substitute all-purporse flour, or a half and half mixture of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour. The cookies can be kept fresh for a few days or frozen."
