steps:
  - "In a 2-quart microwave-safe casserole, crumble the ground beef with the green onions. Cover and microwave on HIGH for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the beef is no longer pink. Drain off excess fat."
  - "Stir in the tomatoes, salt, chili powder, oregano, and pepper. Cover and microwave on HIGH for 3 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling. Spread the meat mixture in a greased 9×9-inch microwave-safe baking dish."
  - "In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk water and cornmeal together. Microwave on HIGH for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring every minute, until thickened. Stir in the olives."
  - "Spread the cornmeal mixture over the beef and sprinkle with cheese. Microwave uncovered on HIGH for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cheese melts and the filling is hot. Let stand 5 minutes before serving."
