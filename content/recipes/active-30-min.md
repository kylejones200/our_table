ingredients:
  - "2 cups fresh pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch pieces"
  - "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
  - "1 envelope unflavored powdered gelatin"
  - "1/4 cup water"
  - "1 -14 oz. can sweetened condensed mil."
  - "1 -14 oz can unsweetened coconut milk"
  - "1 Tbl plus 1 tsp fresh lime juice"
  - "1/8 tsp pure vanilla extract"
  - "1 large egg white"
  - "2 Tbl light brown sugar"
  - "1/2 c salted roasted cashews, split lengthwise"
steps:
  - "In a small skillet, cook the pineapple with the granulated sugar over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the pineapple is just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to an 8 inch square glass or ceramic baking dish. In a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the sweetened condensed milk with the coconut milk, 1 Tbl of the lime juice and the vanilla. Warm the gelatin over moderate heat, swirling the pan, until dissolved. Pour the gelatin mixture into the condensed milk mixture and stir gently until blended. In a stainless steel bowl, beat the egg white until firm peaks form; fold into the condensed-milk mixture, then pour the mixture over the pineapple. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, combine the brown sugar with the remaining 1 tsp of lime juice and cook over moderately high heat until just melted. Add the cashews and stir to coat. Transfer to a plate to cool and harden."
  - "Carefully cut the coconut pudding into squares and transfer to plates with a metal spatula. Sprinkle each square with candied cashews and serve."
notes: "This dessert is a rich, creamy pudding with deep tropical flavors and a sweet, nutty garnish. It can be molded in a 8-inch square pan, but it can also be prepared in individual custard cups or ramekins. Cooking the pineapple mixture is key because raw pineapple contains an enzyme that prevents a pudding from setting. The pudding can be made the day before and refrigerated overnight.
