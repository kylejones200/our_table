ingredients:
  - "5 ounces soba or whole wheat noodles"
  - "3 cups small broccoli florets"
  - "2 large carrots cut into thin diagonal slices"
  - "2 tsp toasted sesame oil"
  - "1 cup thinly sliced scallions"
  - "1 Tbsp minced peeled fresh ginger"
  - "1 Tbsp minced garlic"
  - "12 ounces skinned salmon fillets in 4 steaks"
  - "1 tsp grated lemon peel"
  - "2 Tbsp creamy peanut butter"
  - "2 Tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce"
  - "2 Tbsp lemon juice"
  - "1 1/2 -2 tsp Asian chili-and-garlic sauce"
  - "1 1/2 cups julienne-cut hothouse cucumber"
steps:
  - "Bring a large covered pot of water to a boil over high heat."
  - "Add the soba or whole wheat noodles and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add the broccoli and carrots and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes longer, or until the noodles are tender and the vegetables crisp-tender. Scoop out and reserve about 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Drain the noodles and vegetables in a colander. In a large nonstick skillet, stir the oil, scallions, ginger and garlic. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the scallions are wilted. Transfer half of the mixture to a large salad bowl, leaving the remaining half in the skillet."
  - "Add the salmon to the skillet and sprinkle with the lemon peel. Cook, turning once with a spatula, after 4 to 5 minutes, until just opaque in the thickest part. Remove from the heat. With a whisk, mix the peanut butter, soy sauce, lemon juice, and chili sauce into the scallion mixture in the salad bowl. Gradually whisk in 3 to 4 Tbsp of the reserved pasta cooking liquid until creamy."
  - "Add the noodles, vegetables, and cucumber to the peanut butter mixture and toss to mix well. Add the salmon and any pan juices to the top of the noodle mixture. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 1 or 2 hours, until ready to serve. If the salad is too dry, add a little more pasta cooking liquid."
