total_time: "42 minutes"




ingredients:
  - "4 pounds russet (Idaho) potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces"
  - "1 1/2 cups whole milk"
  - "8 Tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces"
  - "2 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 tsp pepper"

steps:
  - "COOK POTATOES: Place cut potatoes in colander. Rinse under cold water until water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain potatoes. Fill Dutch oven with 1 inch water. Bring water to boil. Place steamer basket in Dutch oven and fill with potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook covered, until potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. WARM DAIRY: Heat milk, butter, salt, and pepper in small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking until smooth, about 3 minutes; cover and keep warm."
  - "WHIP POTATOES: Pour contents of Dutch oven into colander and return potatoes to dry pot. Stir over low heat until potatoes are thoroughly dried, about 1 minute. In bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, break potatoes into small pieces on low speed, about 30 seconds. Add milk mixture in steady stream until incorporated. Increase speed to high and whip until potatoes are light and fluffy and no lumps remain, about 2 minutes. Serve. note: Don't try this recipe in your food processor—its sharp blades cut open the starch granules and turn the potatoes to glue. The beating motion of the mixer makes smooth, fluffy potatoes every time."

notes: "If your steamer basket has short legs (under 1 3/4 inches), the potatoes will sit in the water as they cook and get wet. To prevent this, use balls of aluminum foil as steamer basket stilts. A stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment yields the smoothes potatoes, but a hand mixer may be used as well."
