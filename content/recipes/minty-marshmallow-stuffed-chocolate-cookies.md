Fudgy frosting ---"
  - "2 cups confectioners' sugar"
  - "1/4 cup cocoa powder"
  - "4 Tbsp (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled"
  - "1/4 cup milk"
  - "1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract"
steps:
  - "Garnish: chopped chocolate mints (like Andes) or mini-chocolate chips"
  - "Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg, milk, and extracts, and beat until well combined. Add reserved flour mixture; mix on low speed until combined."
  - "Drop dough by rounded Tbsp onto ungreased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies begin to spread and become firm, about 7 minutes."
  - "Remove baking sheets from oven, and place a marshmallow in the center of each cookie, pressing down slightly. Return to oven, and continue baking until marshmallows begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven and press down on marshmallows to flatten. (See picture…this is after I pushed down to flatten a bit.) Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. To make the frosting, sift confectioners sugar and cocoa into a medium bowl. Use an electric mixer to stir in butter. Add milk and vanilla, and beat until well-combined."
  - "Spread frosting over each marshmallow, starting in the center and continuing outward until marshmallow is covered."
  - "Garnish with chopped chocolate mints or mini chocolate chips. note: Store covered in the fridge. I think these are even better on the second and third day!"
notes: "If you can't find the chocolate mint marshmallows, any of the holiday flavors will do."
