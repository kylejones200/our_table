steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl cream butter and sugar until light, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg, milk, vanilla, and peppermint extract until smooth. Mix in the dry ingredients on low speed just until combined."
  - "Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake 7 minutes, until cookies spread and edges look set."
  - "Remove the sheets from the oven and press a marshmallow into the center of each cookie. Return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, until the marshmallows puff. Gently flatten each marshmallow with the back of a spoon. Transfer cookies to a rack and cool completely."
  - "For the frosting, sift confectioners' sugar and cocoa into a bowl. Using a mixer, blend in the melted butter. Add milk and vanilla and beat until glossy and spreadable."
  - "Spread frosting over each marshmallow, covering it completely. Garnish with chopped chocolate mints or mini chocolate chips if desired. Store covered and chilled."
