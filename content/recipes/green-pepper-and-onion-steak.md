  - "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear half the beef strips until browned, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and beef."
  - "Measure the reserved tomato juices and add enough water to total 1 cup. Whisk the cornstarch into the reserved marinade, then stir in the tomato liquid."
  - "Return all beef to the skillet. Add tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers. Pour in the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until vegetables are crisp-tender and the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve over hot rice."
