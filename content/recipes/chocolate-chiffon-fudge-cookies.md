ingredients:
  - "1 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips, divided"
  - "3 large egg whites, room temperature"
  - "2 1/4 cups confectioners sugar, divided"
  - "1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
  - "1 Tbsp cornstarch"
  - "1/4 tsp salt"
steps:
  - "Place 1 cup chocolate chips in a microwave-safe container. Melt chips in microwave, stirring every 30 seconds or so, for about 2 minutes or until no longer lumpy. Set aside to cool slightly. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites in a large bowl to soft peak stage. Gradually beat in 1 cup confectioners sugar. Continue beating meringue mixture until it reaches stiff peak. In a separate bowl, whisk 3/4 cup confectioners sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt. On low speed, beat dry ingredients into meringue just until combined. Stir in lukewarm chocolate and remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips."
  - "Cover and chill dough for 1 hour (up to overnight). Don't skip this or your cookies will be too flat."
  - "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line cookie sheets with silpat or parchment (do not skip this with these cookiesâ€¦they will stick)."
  - "Place remaining 1/2 cup confectioners sugar in bowl. Roll 1 level Tbsp of dough into ball; roll in sugar, coating thickly. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake until puffed and tops crack, about 10 minutes. Cool on sheets on rack 10 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool."
notes: "Splurge on the best quality bittersweet chips you can find. You'll taste the difference in these."
