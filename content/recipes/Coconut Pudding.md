ingredients:
  - "2 cups fresh pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch pieces"
  - "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
  - "1 envelope unflavored powdered gelatin"
  - "1/4 cup water"
  - "1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk"
  - "1 (14 oz) can unsweetened coconut milk"
  - "1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp fresh lime juice"
  - "1/8 tsp pure vanilla extract"
  - "1 large egg white"
  - "2 Tbsp light brown sugar"
  - "1/2 cup salted roasted cashews, split lengthwise"
steps:
  - "In a small skillet, cook the pineapple with the granulated sugar over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the pineapple is just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to an 8-inch square glass or ceramic baking dish."
  - "In a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes."
  - "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the sweetened condensed milk with the coconut milk, 1 Tbsp of the lime juice and the vanilla."
  - "Warm the gelatin over moderate heat, swirling the pan, until dissolved. Pour the gelatin mixture into the condensed milk mixture and stir gently until blended."
  - "In a stainless steel bowl, beat the egg white until firm peaks form; fold into the condensed-milk mixture, then pour the mixture over the pineapple. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours."
  - "Meanwhile, in a small skillet, combine the brown sugar with the remaining 1 tsp of lime juice and cook over moderately high heat until just melted. Add the cashews and stir to coat. Transfer to a plate to cool and harden."
  - "Carefully cut the coconut pudding into squares and transfer to plates with a metal spatula. Sprinkle each square with candied cashews and serve."
notes: "This dessert is a rich, creamy pudding with deep tropical flavors and a sweet, nutty garnish. It can be molded in a 8-inch square pan, but it can also be prepared in individual custard cups or ramekins. Cooking the pineapple mixture is key because raw pineapple contains an enzyme that prevents a pudding from setting. The pudding can be made the day before and refrigerated overnight. (Food and Wine, December 2006)."
