steps:
  - "Bake cake according to directions on the box. After the cake is cool, crumble into large bowl."
  - "Mix the frosting with 1 tsp of peppermint extract."
  - "Mix the cake thoroughly with about 3/4 of the frosting. (Get your hands in there and get dirty.) Add more frosting if you think the mixture is too dry. When you can form it into a ball in your hands easily, you're good."
  - "Use a Tbs-sized scoop and roll mixture into balls. Place on a cookie sheet."
  - "Chill or freeze cake balls for several hours. They can also be placed in freezer bags and kept for later use."
  - "Melt almond bark according to the directions on package. Dip each ball about 3/4 way into the almond bark. Tap off excess place on wax paper, cake side down, until firm. Quickly sprinkle a little bit of crushed candy cane bits onto the top of the cake ball before the almond bark hardens."
  - "Cover the truffles tightly and store where it is cool."
