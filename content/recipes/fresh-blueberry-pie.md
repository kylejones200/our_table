ingredients:
  - "2 1/3 cups unbleached flour"
  - "3 tsp baking powder"
  - "1/3 cup canola oil"
  - "1/2 cup skim milk"
  - "1 cup sugar"
  - "1/2 tsp grated lemon rind"
  - "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
  - "4 cups fresh blueberries"
steps:
  - "Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Coat a 9\" no-stick pie pan with no-stick spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk 2 cups of the flour with the baking powder. Alternately add the oil and milk, stirring until the dough forms a ball. Divide the dough in half. Place one half of the dough on a large piece of wax paper. Top with another large sheet of wax paper. Roll out to a 12\" circle. Remove the top sheet of paper and gently invert the dough into the prepared pan. Remove the remaining sheet of wax paper. Firmly press the dough against the bottom and sides of the pan. Trim the dough that extends beyond the edge of the pan. Add the trimmed pieces to the remaining dough. Roll the dough out to a 12\" circle between the wax paper; set aside. In a large bowl, gently mix the sugar, lemon rind, cinnamon, blueberries and the remaining 1/3 cup flour. Pour the filling into the pie shell."
  - "Remove the top sheet of wax paper and carefully invert the top crust over the pie filling. Fold the edges under. Seal and crimp to form a rim. Using a sharp knife, make slits in the top."
