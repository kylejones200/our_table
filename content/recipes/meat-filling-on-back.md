steps:
  - "Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in salt, sugar, oil and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 hour. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.) Punch down dough; divide into 6 equal parts. Shape into balls. Let rise 30 minutes. Sprinkle 3 ungreased cookie sheets with cornmeal. Roll each ball into circle 1/8 inch thick. Place 2 circles in opposite corners of each cookie sheet. Let rise 30 minutes. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Bake until loaves are puffed and light brown, about 10 minutes. Tear or cut each loaf crosswise into halves. Fill each half with 1/2 cup meat filling. Serve immediately. Or place hot unfilled loaves in plastic bags to keep moist and pliable until ready to serve."
