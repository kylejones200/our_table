ingredients:
  - "3/4 cup quick-cooking oats"
  - "1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened"
  - "1/4 cup brown sugar"
  - "1 large egg"
  - "3/4 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "3/4 cup all-purpose flour"
  - "3/4 tsp baking soda"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 cup finely crushed Biscoff (or other spice) cookies"
  - "3/4 cup white chocolate chips"
steps:
  - "Lightly toast your dry oats by placing in a large frypan over medium heat; cook about 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until oats turn golden and become aromatic. Remove from heat and cool."
  - "Use an electric mixer to combine butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla, mix until combined. In a separate bowl combine flour, baking soda, salt and Biscoff crumbs. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating just until combined. Stir in toasted oats and white chocolate chips."
  - "Chill 30 minutes (up to overnight). If chilling overnight, let sit on counter for 10 minutes or so before scooping."
  - "Heat oven to 350 degrees F."
  - "Drop rounded Tbsp of dough onto cookie sheet Bake 10 minutes or until barely golden brown on the edges. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool."
notes: "Do not skip the toasting-the-oats step. It's a dealbreaker in these. Biscoff are those yummy spice cookies we talked about here. If you can't find them, sub any spice cookie"
