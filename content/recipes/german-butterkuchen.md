TOPPING ---"
steps:
  - "Scald the milk, add 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and shortening, and cool to lukewarm. Dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in warm water, then stir into cooled milk mixture. Beat the eggs with 1 cup of the flour."
  - "Add rest of flour alternately with milk-yeast mixture, mixing well after each addition. Pour into greased 9 x 13 inch baking pan, spreading dough evenly. Set in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes."
  - "Sprinkle the butter topping and almonds evenly over top and bake in moderate hot oven, 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or until lightly brown."
  - "Cut 1/2 cup butter into 1 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon until fine crumbs develop."
