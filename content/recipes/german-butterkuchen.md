steps:
  - "Scald the milk in a small saucepan. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and shortening until melted; cool to lukewarm. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water and let stand until foamy, then stir into the cooled milk mixture. Beat in the eggs with 1 cup of the flour."
  - "Add the remaining flour gradually, mixing until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Spread evenly in a greased 9×13-inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until puffy, about 45 minutes."
  - "For the topping, blend the butter, sugar, and cinnamon with a fork until sandy crumbs form."
  - "Gently dimple the risen dough with your fingertips. Sprinkle with the topping and almonds. Bake at 375°F until golden and set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing."
