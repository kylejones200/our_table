steps:
  - "FOR THE DOUGH: Whisk buttermilk, butter, and eggs together in a large liquid measuring cup; set aside. Mix 4 cups flour, granulated sugar, yeast, and salt in stand mixer fitted with dough hook. With mixer on low speed, add buttermilk mixture and mix until dough comes together, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (After 5 minutes, if dough is sticky, add remaining 1/4 cup of flour, 1 Tbsp at a time, as needed until dough clears side of bowl but sticks to bottom). Turn dough out onto clean work surface and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball, about 1 minute. Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and cover loosely with greased plastic wrap. Let rise in warm place until dough has doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. FOR FILLING: Butter 13 by 9-inch baking dish; set aside. Mix brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves (or nutmeg), and salt together in small bowl. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface and press into 16 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush dough with melted butter. Sprinkle sugar mixture over dough, leaving 3/4 inch order along top edge. Press on sugar mixture to adhere to dough."
  - "Roll dough into tight cylinder and pinch seam closed. Roll cylinder over, seam side down. Gently stretch cylinder until 18 inches in length, with even diameter. Pat ends of cylinder to even. Slice cylinder into 12 evenly sized rolls using serrated knife. Arrange rolls, cut side down, in prepared baking dish. TO STORE: Without pressing on rolls, wrap baking dish tightly with greased plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 16 hours. TO SERVE: Remove rolls from refrigerator, loosen plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature until puffy and pressed against one another, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, whisk cream cheese, vanilla extract, and buttermilk together in large bowl until thick and smooth. Sift confectioners' sugar over mixture and whisk until smooth, about 30 seconds; set aside."
