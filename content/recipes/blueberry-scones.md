ingredients:
  - "16 Tbsp (2 sticks) unsalted butter, frozen whole (8 Tbls for dough)"
  - "1 1/2 cups (about 7 1/2 ounces) fresh blueberries, picked over"
  - "1/2 cup whole milk"
  - "1/2 cup sour cream"
  - "2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour, plus additional for work surface"
  - "1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) sugar, plus 1 Tbsp for sprinkling"
  - "2 tsp baking powder"
  - "1/4 tsp baking soda"
  - "1/2 tsp table salt"
  - "1 tsp finely grated zest from 1 lemon"
  - "note: It is important to work the dough as little as possible-work quickly and knead and fold the dough only the number of times called for. The butter should be frozen solid before grating. In hot or humid environments, chill the flour mixture and workbowls before use. While the recipe calls for 2 whole sticks of butter, only 10 Tbsp are actually used (see step 1). If fresh berries are unavailable, an equal amount of frozen berries (do not defrost) can be substituted. An equal amount of raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries can be used in place of the blueberries. Cut larger berries into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces before incorporating. Refrigerate or freeze leftover scones, wrapped in foil, in an airtight container. To serve, remove foil and place scones on a baking sheet in a 375-degree oven. Heat until warmed through and recrisped, 8 to 10 minutes if refrigerated, 16 to 20 minutes if frozen. TO MAKE IN ADVANCE-Mix the dough, cut the scones, place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and refrigerate them overnight. To bake scones, heat oven to 425 degrees, then follow the directions from step 6. For frozen scones, heat oven to 375 degrees, follow directions from step 6, and extend cooking time to 25 to 30 minutes."
steps:
  - "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Score and remove half of wrapper from each stick of frozen butter. Grate unwrapped ends on large holes of box grater (you should grate total of 8 Tbs). Place grated butter in freezer until needed. Melt 2 Tbsp of remaining ungrated butter and set aside. Save remaining 6 Tbsp butter for another use. Place blueberries in freezer until needed."
  - "Whisk together milk and sour cream in medium bowl; refrigerate until needed. Whisk flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest in medium bowl. Add frozen butter to flour mixture and toss with fingers until thoroughly coated."
  - "Add milk mixture to flour mixture; fold with spatula until just combined. With rubber spatula, transfer dough to liberally floured work surface. Dust surface of dough with flour; with floured hands, knead dough 6 to 8 times, until it just holds together in ragged ball, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking."
  - "Roll dough into approximate 12-inch square. Fold dough into thirds like a business letter, using bench scraper or metal spatula to release dough if it sticks to countertop. Lift short ends of dough and fold into thirds again to form approximate 4-inch square. Transfer dough to plate lightly dusted with flour and chill in freezer 5 minutes."
  - "Transfer dough to floured work surface and roll into approximate 12-inch square again. Sprinkle blueberries evenly over surface of dough, then press down so they are slightly embedded in dough. Using bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen dough from work surface. Roll dough, pressing to form tight log. Lay seam-side down and press log into 12 by 4-inch rectangle. Using sharp, floured knife, cut rectangle crosswise into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally to form 2 triangles and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet."
