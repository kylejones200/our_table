--- Vinaigrette ---"
  - "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"
  - "1 1/2 Tbsp red wine vinegar"
  - "2 tsp Dijon mustard"
  - "1 small shallot, minced"
  - "1/8 tsp table salt"
  - "--- Salad ---"
  - "1 1/2 cup pecans"
  - "12 ounces goat cheese, softened"
  - "2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives"
  - "1 tsp minced fresh thyme leaves"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "12 cups hearty salad greens"
  - "Vinaigrette: Combine all ingredients in jar, seal lid, and shake vigorously until emulsified; set aside."
  - "Salad: Pulse pecans in food processor until finely chopped; transfer to medium bowl. Add cheese, chives, and thyme to food processor and process until smooth. Refrigerate cheese mixture in covered bowl until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days."
  - "Using hands, roll 2 Tbsp chilled cheese mixture at a time into twelve 11/2-inch balls. Beat eggs in medium bowl. One at a time, dip balls in egg, then roll in nuts, pressing gently to adhere. Place balls 2 inches apart on rimmed baking sheet. Press balls into 2-inch disks with greased measuring cup. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until completely firm, at least 2 hours or up to 1 week."
  - "Adjust oven rack to upper position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Remove plastic and spray cheese lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Bake until nuts are golden brown and cheese is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cook 3 minutes. Toss greens with vinaigrette. Serve warm cheese rounds over dressed greens."
notes: "For a sweet counterpoint to the herb flavor, add 1 cup dried cherries, golden raisins or dried cranberries to the salad just before tossing it."
