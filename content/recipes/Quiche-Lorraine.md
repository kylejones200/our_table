prep_time: "10 minutes"

cook_time: "130 minutes"

total_time: "140 minutes"


ingredients:
  - "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more if needed (175g/6 oz)"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1 tsp superfine sugar (optional)"
  - "1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut in small pieces (120g/4oz)"
  - "3-8 Tbsp iced water"

steps:
  - "In a large bowl, sift together the flour, salt and sugar (if using). Pulse the ingredients in a food processor."
  - "Slowly add the water, mixing until a crumbly dough begins to form; do not overwork the dough or it will be tough. Pinch a piece of the dough; it should hold together. If the dough is crumbly add a little more water. IF it is wet and sticky, sprinkle over a little more flour. Turn the dough on to a piece of plastic wrap. Hold the film with one hand and use your other hand to push the dough away from you until the dough is smooth and pliable. Flatten the dough to a round and wrap in the plastic wrap. Chill for 2 hours or overnight. Leave to soften for 10 minutes at room temperature before rolling out. To line a pie tin: lightly butter a 9-10 inch loose-based pie tin. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thick. Gently roll the pastry loosely around the rolling pin, then unroll over the in and gently ease the pastry into the tin leave 1 inch overhang. With floured fingers, press the overhang down slightly toward the base of the pan to reinforce the side; roll the rolling pin over the rim to cut off the excess. Press the pastry against the side of the tin to forma rim slightly higher than the tin. If you like, crimp the edge. Prick the base with a fork and chill for at least one hour."
