source: "Cook's Country Oct/Nov 2008"
ingredients:
  - "1 (24 oz) loaf hearty white sandwich bread, cut into 1/2 inch pieces (about 16 cups)"
  - "8 Tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter"
  - "2 onions, chopped fine"
  - "3 celery ribs, chopped fine"
  - "4 garlic cloves, minced"
  - "1 1/2 tsp dried sage"
  - "1 1/2 tsp dried thyme"
  - "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth"
  - "1 Tbsp soy sauce"
  - "4 large eggs"
  - "1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley"
  - "1 1/2 cups half-and-half"
  - "1 tsp salt"
  - "1 1/2 tsp pepper"
steps:
  - "Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Arrange bread in single layer on 2 baking sheets. Bake until golden, about 30 minutes, stirring bread and switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool."
  - "Melt 4 Tbsp butter in large skillet over medium heat. Cook onions and celery until golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic, sage, and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and soy sauce and simmer until slightly thickened and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes."
  - "Whisk eggs, half-and-half, parsley, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Slowly whisk in warm onion mixture until incorporated. Fold in toasted bread and let sit, tossing occasionally, until bread is saturated, about 20 minutes."
  - "Transfer stuffing to greased 13- by 9-inch pan. Melt remaining butter and drizzle evenly over stuffing. Bake on lower-middle rack until top is golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes. Serve."
notes: "Firm sandwich breads, like Arnold Country Classics White or Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Hearty White, work best here."
