ingredients:
  - "1/2 cup pure maple syrup"
  - "1/4 cup soy sauce"
  - "4 salmon fillets, 11/4 inches thick"
notes: "Try to find fillets that are of similar size (about 6 ounces) for even cooking times. If the fillets are thinner than 1 1/4 inches, they will cook much more quickly and won't have enough oven time to glaze nicely. This recipe will work with both skin-on and skinless fillets."
