ingredients:
  - "1 9-inch pie shell, chilled in the pie plate for 30 minutes"

Pumpkin Filling:
  - "1 (15 oz) can pumpkin puree"
  - "3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar"
  - "2 tsp ground cinnamon"
  - "1 tsp ground ginger"
  - "1/2 tsp ground allspice"
  - "Pinch ground cloves"
  - "1/2 tsp kosher salt"
  - "1 cup evaporated milk"
  - "3 large eggs"
  - "2 tsp vanilla extract"

Praline Topping:
  - "1 cup finely chopped pecans"
  - "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar"
  - "Pinch kosher salt"
  - "2 tsp dark corn syrup"
  - "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "2 tsp granulated sugar"

allergens:
  - "dairy"
  - "eggs"

notes: "Use your favorite pie crust recipe or a refrigerated crust. The prebaked shell can be prepared a day ahead."

steps:
  - "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350°F. Line the chilled pie shell with foil, fill with pie weights, and bake 20 to 25 minutes until the dough looks dry. Remove the foil and weights, prick the crust with a fork, and bake 10 to 15 minutes more until lightly browned. Set aside."
  - "Puree the pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Cook the mixture in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring, until it sputters and thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat."
  - "Whisk in the evaporated milk, then the eggs and vanilla. Pour the filling into the warm pie shell and bake about 35 minutes, until the edges are puffed and the center jiggles slightly."
  - "Meanwhile, mix the pecans, brown sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, using your fingers to coat the nuts evenly."
  - "Scatter the topping over the partially baked pie, sprinkle with granulated sugar, and bake about 10 minutes more, until the pecans are fragrant and the topping bubbles at the edges. Cool completely before slicing."
