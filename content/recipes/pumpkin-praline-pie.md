Pumpkin Filling ---"
  - "1 15 ounce can plain pie puree"
  - "3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar"
  - "2 tsp cinnamon"
  - "1 tsp ginger"
  - "1/2 tsp allspice"
  - "pinch cloves"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1 cup evaporated milk"
  - "3 large eggs"
  - "2 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "--- Praline Topping ---"
  - "1 cup pecans, chopped fine"
  - "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar"
  - "pinch salt"
  - "2 tsp dark corn syrup"
  - "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "2 tsp granulated sugar"
steps:
  - "BAKE PIE SHELL: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line pie shell with foil, cover with 2 cups pie weights (pennies or dried beans are fine too), and bake until dough under foil dried out, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove foil and weights, poke crust several times with fork, and continue to bake until firmly set and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pie shell from oven (keep oven on) and set aside. Shell can be cooled, wrapped tightly in plastic, and stored at room temperature for 1 day. FILLING: Puree pumpkin, brown sugar, spices, and salt in food processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Cook mixture in large saucepan over medium-high until sputtering and thickened, about 4 minutes, and remove from heat. Meanwhile, put pie shell back in oven to warm."
  - "Whisk evaporated milk into pumpkin mixture, then whisk in eggs and vanilla. Pour filling into warmed pie shell and bake until filling is puffed and cracked around edges and center barely jiggles when pie is shaken, about 35 minutes. PRALINE TOPPING: While pie is baking, toss pecans, brown sugar, and salt in bowl. Add corn syrup and vanilla, using fingers to ensure that ingredients are well blended. Scatter topping evenly over puffed filling and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake until pecans are fragrant and topping is bubbling around edges, about 10 minutes. Cool pie completely on wire rack, at least 2 hours. Pie can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Serve pie at room temperature."
notes: "Use your favorite pie dough. For a convenient option, use one sheet of Pillsbury Just Unroll Pie Crusts."
