ingredients:
  - "1 cup all-purpose flour"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp shortening"
  - "2 to 3 Tbsp cold water"

Filling:
  - "1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) strawberries, hulled"
  - "1 cup granulated sugar"
  - "2 Tbsp cornstarch"
  - "1/2 cup water"
  - "Red food coloring, optional"
  - "3 oz cream cheese, softened"
  - "1 tsp grated lemon peel"

allergens:
  - "dairy"
  - "gluten"

steps:
  - "Combine flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles small peas. Sprinkle in cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork until the dough almost cleans the bowl. Shape into a disk, wrap, and chill about 45 minutes."
  - "Heat the oven to 475°F. Roll the pastry into a circle 2 inches larger than a 9-inch pie plate. Fit into the plate, trim, and flute. Prick the crust all over with a fork and bake 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned. Cool completely."
  - "Mash enough strawberries to make 1 cup. In a saucepan mix sugar and cornstarch, then stir in the mashed berries, water, and food coloring if using. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until thick and boiling. Boil 1 minute and cool."
  - "Beat cream cheese with lemon zest until smooth and spread over the cooled crust. Arrange remaining whole strawberries in the shell and pour the cooled glaze over the top. Chill until set, at least 3 hours."

notes: "For neat slices, refrigerate the pie at least 4 hours and use a serrated knife dipped in hot water between cuts."
