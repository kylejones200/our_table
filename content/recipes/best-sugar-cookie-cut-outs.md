ingredients:
  - "3 cups (13.5 oz) all-purpose flour*"
  - "1 tsp baking powder"
  - "2 sticks butter, unsalted, softened (8 oz)"
  - "1 cup granulated sugar"
  - "1 large egg"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  - "1/4 tsp almond extract"
  - "note: I highly suggest weighing the flour if you have a scale. If you don't have one, make sure you're lightly spooning the flour in the measuring cup then sweeping to level it off. (Don't dunk the whole cup in the flour.)"
  - "Pinch off half the dough and keep the rest chilled and covered while you work with the first half. Roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface to approximately 1/4-inch thick. Cut the cookies into shapes, re-rolling dough once to use scraps, and place the cut cookie shape on a parchment or silpat-lined cookie sheet. Place the whole cookie sheet back in the fridge (or on your porch/garage if it's cold) for 30 min. (This will ensure the cookies don't spread when you bake them.) Repeat with other half of dough."

steps:
  - "Sift together the flour and baking powder. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, salt and both extracts and mix until combined."
  - "Slowly add flour mixture (1 cup at a time) and mix just until incorporated"
  - "Form the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight."
  - "Preheat oven to 375."
  - "Bake the cookies for approximately 8-10 minutes or just until the edges begin to turn golden brown. Remove cookies from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes."

notes: "The refrigeration just before baking is key to the cookie holding its shape and not spreading. Don't skip it!"
