ingredients:
  - "1 box devil's food cake mix"
  - "1 can chocolate frosting (16 oz.)"
  - "1 tsp peppermint extract"
  - "1 package almond bark"
  - "8 candy canes, crushed"
  - "Waxed paper"
steps:
  - "Bake cake according to directions on the box for 13 x 9 cake. After the cake is cool, crumble into large bowl."
  - "Mix the frosting with 1 tsp of peppermint extract."
  - "Mix the cake thoroughly with about 3/4 of the frosting. Add more frosting if you think the mixture is too dry. When you can form it into a ball in your hands easily, you're good."
  - "Use a Tbsp-sized scoop and roll mixture into balls. Place on a cookie sheet."
  - "Chill or freeze cake balls for several hours. They can also be placed in freezer bags and kept for later use."
  - "Melt almond bark according to the directions on package. Dip each ball about 3/4 way into the almond bark."
  - "Tap off excess and place on wax paper, cake side down, until firm. Quickly sprinkle crushed candy cane bits onto the top before the almond bark hardens."
  - "Cover the truffles tightly and store where it is cool."
notes: "I leave a little bit of chocolate cake showing at the bottom of these. It's prettier and much easier to handle when dipping."
