--- TOMATO-MEAT SAUCE ---"
  - "1 Tbsp olive oil"
  - "1 medium onion, chopped fine"
  - "6 medium garlic cloves, minced"
  - "1 pound meatloaf mix or 1/3 lb each ground beef chuck, ground veal, and ground pork (or lean beef)"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
  - "1/4 cup heavy cream"
  - "1 28-ounce can tomato puree"
  - "1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained"
  - "--- RICOTTA, MOZZARELLA, AND PASTA LAYERS ---"
  - "15 ounces whole-milk or part-skim ricotta cheese (about 2 cups)"
  - "2 1/2 ounces Parmesan chees, grated (about 1 1/4 cup)"
  - "1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves"
  - "1 large egg, lightly beaten"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
  - "12 no-boil lasagna noodles from one 8 or 9-ounce package"
  - "1 pound whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 5 1/3 cups)"
steps:
  - "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375 degrees. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the ground meat, salt, and pepper; cook, breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the meat loses its raw color but has not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the cream; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and only the fat remains, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato puree and drained diced tomatoes; bring to a slow simmer and cook until the flavors are blended, about 3 minutes; set the sauce aside. FOR THE LAYERS: Mix the ricotta, 1 cup of the Parmesan, the basil, egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined and creamy; set aside. Smear the entire bottom of a 9 by 13- inch baking dish (or a shallow casserole dish of similar size) with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce (avoiding large chunks of meat). Place 3 of the noodles in the baking dish to create the first layer. Drop 1/3 cup of the ricotta mixture down the center of each noodle and level the domed mounds by pressing with the back of the measuring spoon. Sprinkle evenly with 1 1/3 cups of the mozzarella. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce evenly over the cheese. Repeat the layering of the noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and sauce two more times. Place the 3 remaining noodles on top of the sauce, then spread the remaining sauce over the noodles, sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/3 cups mozzarella, and then with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Planning Ahead: Assemble the casserole as directed in step 4 but do not bake. Wrap the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze, tightly wrapped with an additional layer of foil, for up to 2 months. If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours."
