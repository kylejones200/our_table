steps:
  - "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375°F. Warm the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds."
  - "Add the meatloaf mix, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, breaking the meat into small pieces, until no longer pink. Stir in the cream and simmer, stirring, until the liquid evaporates and the fat glistens, about 4 minutes."
  - "Pour in the tomato puree and diced tomatoes. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, 10 minutes to thicken slightly. Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning."
  - "In a medium bowl combine the ricotta, 1 cup of the Parmesan, basil, egg, remaining salt, and remaining pepper. Stir until creamy and evenly blended."
  - "Spread 1/4 cup sauce in the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 noodles, a third of the ricotta mixture, 1 1/3 cups mozzarella, and 1 1/2 cups sauce. Repeat the layers twice more."
  - "Top with the final noodles, remaining sauce, remaining mozzarella, and the reserved Parmesan. Cover tightly with foil and bake 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake 15 minutes longer, until bubbling and browned. Rest 15 minutes before slicing."
