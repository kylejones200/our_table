--- Mustard-Maple Glaze ---"
  - "1/2 cup pure maple syrup"
  - "2/3 cup whole-grain mustard"
  - "1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar"
  - "salt and ground black pepper"
steps:
  - "HEAT OVEN: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees."
  - "SEASON AND BROWN PORK: Pat tenderloins dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown tenderloins on all sides, about 5 minutes total. ROAST PORK: Transfer skillet to oven and roast pork until thickest part of tenderloins register 140 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 18 to 20 minutes. PREPARE GLAZE: Whisk maple syrup, mustard, and vinegar together and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Note: The glaze requires no cooking, but if you would like to warm it, place it in a microwave-safe container, cover, and microwave on high for 30 seconds to one minute. note: Follow recipe for Pan-Roasted Pork Tenderloins. In place of glaze, prepare Tart Cherry Glaze as follows: In step 4, process 1 cup cherry preserves, 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, and 1 tsp minced fresh thyme in blender ( or food processor) or until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
notes: "Try to find small pork tenderloins of equal size so that they will cook quickly and evenly. If the tenderloins you find are larger than 1 pound, you will need to increase the roasting time accordingly. The glaze requires no cooking, but if you would like to warm the glaze, place it in a microwave-safe container, cover, and microwave on high for 30 seconds to one minute."
