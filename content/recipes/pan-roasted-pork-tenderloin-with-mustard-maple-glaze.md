ingredients:
  - "2 pork tenderloins (1 lb each), trimmed"
  - "1 Tbsp vegetable oil"
  - "1 1/2 tsp kosher salt"
  - "1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper"

Mustard-Maple Glaze:
  - "1/2 cup pure maple syrup"
  - "2/3 cup whole-grain mustard"
  - "1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar"
  - "Salt and black pepper, to taste"

allergens: []

notes: "Try to find small pork tenderloins of equal size so they cook quickly and evenly. Warm the glaze briefly in the microwave if you prefer it hot, or substitute a tart cherry glaze by blending 1 cup cherry preserves with 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme."

steps:
  - "Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 475°F."
  - "Pat the pork dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking."
  - "Brown the tenderloins on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast 18 to 20 minutes, until the thickest part registers 140°F. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, tent with foil, and rest 5 minutes."
  - "Whisk the maple syrup, mustard, and vinegar together and season with salt and pepper. Slice the pork and spoon the glaze over the top to serve."
