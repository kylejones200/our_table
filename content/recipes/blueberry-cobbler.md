  - "To make the blueberries: Coat a 9\" no-stick pie pan with no-stick spray and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and cinnamon (if using). Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour into the prepared pie pan. To make the topping: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt (if using), baking soda and baking powder. Using a pastry blender or table knives, cut in the margarine or butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk and vanilla. Mix just until moistened."
  - "Spoon heaping Tbsp of the batter evenly over the blueberries."
  - "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the blueberries are bubbly and the topping is golden brown."
