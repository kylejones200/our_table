--- CRUST ---"
  - "1/3 cup pecans"
  - "1 cup flour"
  - "2 Tbsp sugar, more or less"
  - "2 Tbsp toasted wheat germ"
  - "1/2 tsp salt"
  - "1 Tbsp light olive oil"
  - "3 Tbsp pecan or hazelnut oil"
  - "2 Tbsp ice water"
  - "--- FOR THE FILLING ---"
  - "1 tsp unflavored gelatin"
  - "1/4 cup cold water"
  - "1 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest"
  - "2/3 cup lemon juice"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 Tbsp sour cream"
  - "2 cups blueberries"
steps:
  - "To make the crust: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the pecans on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly crisped. Set on a rack to cool. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F. In a food processor, combine the pecans, flour, wheat germ, sugar, and salt. Process until the pecans are finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the pecan oil, olive oil, and ice water until well combined. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, add the oil mixture, and stir with a fork until well combined. Shape the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick disk."
  - "Roll the dough out between 2 sheets of lightly floured waxed paper into an 11-inch circle (1/8 inch thick). Transfer the dough to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and carefully fit the dough into the pan. Trim the edges even with the top of the tart pan. Prick the bottom all over with a fork."
  - "Line the dough with foil or parchment and weight down with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights, and continue baking for 10 to 12 minutes, until the edge is golden brown and crisp. Set on a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften. In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, olive oil, and eggs, until well combined. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is hot, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the softened gelatin and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is the consistency of thick honey, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature."
