ingredients:
  - "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
  - "2 Tbsp water"

steps:
  - "Combine the sugar and 2 Tbsp water in a medium saucepan (high sides). Do not stir. Cook over medium-high heat to a dark caramel color, swirling as it begins to brown to distribute the sugar. While the sugar and water are going at it, heat up the cream in a saucepan or microwave just until warm. Take off the heat and add your room temperature butter. Whisk the butter in, being sure it is totally combined."
