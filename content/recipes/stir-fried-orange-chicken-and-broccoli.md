ingredients:
  - "1 large bunch broccoli (about 1 1/2 pounds)"
  - "1/2 cup orange juice"
  - "2 Tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce"
  - "2 tsp cornstarch"
  - "2 Tbsp orange marmalade"
  - "1 Tbsp canola oil"
  - "1 pound chicken tenders, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces"
  - "3 scallions, sliced"
  - "3 large cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger"
  - "pinch of red-pepper flakes"
  - "1/3 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth"
  - "1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced"
steps:
  - "Cut the broccoli into small florets. Trim and discard about 2 inches of the tough broccoli stems. Thinly slice the remaining stems. In a small bowl, combine the orange juice, soy sauce, cornstarch, and orange marmalade. Stir until blended. Set the sauce aside. In a wok or large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until no longer pink and the juices run clear. Add the scallions, garlic, ginger, and red-pepper flakes and stir to combine. With a slotted spoon, remove the chicken to a plate."
  - "Add the broth and broccoli to the mixture in the wok and reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes or until the broth evaporates and the vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir the sauce and add to the wok along with the chicken. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and the chicken is hot."
