steps:
  - "Chop potatoes in bite-size pieces, add onion powder, Natures seasoning and 2 cups milk in glass mixing bowl. Microwave for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Melt margarine, stir in flour, mix well, microwave 1 minute. Add the remaining 11/2 cups milk, microwave 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. **(Put gravy mix in blender if lumpy.) Add cubed ham to potatoes, and gravy mix. Mix well, put into 13x9 greased baking dish. Microwave an additional 10-15 minutes, until potatoes are tender. May sprinkle with shredded cheddar cheese last two minutes. May also be baked in 350Â° oven 45 minutes, instead of microwaving the last 10-15 minutes. Add cheese last 5 minutes."
