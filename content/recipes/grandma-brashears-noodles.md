ingredients:
  - "3 eggs"
  - "1 1/2 tsp salt"
  - "2-3 cups of flour"
  - "1-3 Tbsp bacon drippings (1 is enough, but you can use whatever is on hand)"
  - "1 small-medium white or yellow onion, diced"
  - "14 oz diced or crushed tomatoes"
  - "2 cups V8 tomato juice"
  - "1/2-1 1/2 cups water (to create right consistency)"
steps:
  - "Whisk together eggs and salt."
  - "Whisk in 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup at a time. With a wooden or plastic cooking spoons, continue to add flour 1/2 cup at a time until it is difficult to stir and until there is a ragged to well-formed ball of dough. Move dough to clean surface, and continue to add flour by kneading dough, using an additional 3/4 cup - 1 1/2 cup. Continue until the dough is only picking up a little bit of flour and is only tacky to the touch when pulled apart. Separate dough into 2 parts, and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Dough is ready when you roll the dough and it does not retract at all. When dough is rested, roll out in rectagle until thin, about 1/16 of an inch."
  - "Cut dough in half from top to bottom and flour liberally. Place left half on top of right half, aligning cut edges. Flour again. Starting from the bottom, roll the two layers together tightly like a cinnamon roll. With a sharp knife, cut log with quick but light sawing motion about 1/8 of an inch apart. Taking 2-4 pinwheels together at a time, find and gather the outer edges. Gently holding onto these ends, uncoil the pinwheel, and gently tearing the strands about 1 – 1 1/2 inches long for the individual noodles. Toss the torn noodles liberally with noodles to avoid noodle clumps. If cooking immediately, follow direction below for the adding noodles to the tomato base. Noodles can also be kept in the freezer. If freezing, be sure the noodles are well floured so they do not stick together."
  - "Heat bacon drippings on medium heat. Add onions and sauté until translucent and soft but not browned."
  - "Add liquids, bring to a boil, and simmer for 15-20 minutes before adding noodles. When adding noodles, careful sprinkle in small handfuls at a time, stirring constantly to avoid noodle clumps. Maintain an active simmer. If noodles are fresh, room temperature, cook for around 30-45 minutes depending on desired texture and the size of noodles. If thrown in frozen, may taken a little longer. Add salt to taste."
