(I like a pretty big indentation because, let's face it, the caramel is the best part.) Bake at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes, until they're barely golden on the sides. Remove from oven and immediately re-poke your thumbprints if they've faded. (You can use the tip of a wooden spoon if too hot.) Let them cool. While they're cooling, make the caramel.",
      "Combine the sugar and 2 Tbsp water in a medium saucepan (high sides). Do not stir. Cook over medium-high heat to a dark caramel color, swirling as it begins to brown to distribute the sugar. While the sugar and water are going at it, heat up the cream in a saucepan or microwave just until warm. Take off the heat and add your room temperature butter. Whisk the butter in, being sure it's totally combined. Add your warmed cream and whisk vigorously. Mixture will bubble, then settle down to a velvety caramel. By now your cookies should be cooled. Spoon as much warm caramel as you can into the indentations of your cookies and top with sea salt. You may have a bit of caramel left over. Drink it before anyone finds out."

      "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375 degrees. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the ground meat, salt, and pepper; cook, breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the meat loses its raw color but has not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the cream; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and only the fat remains, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato puree and drained diced tomatoes; bring to a slow simmer and cook until the flavors are blended, about 3 minutes; set the sauce aside. FOR THE LAYERS: Mix the ricotta, 1 cup of the Parmesan, the basil, egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined and creamy; set aside. Smear the entire bottom of a 9 by 13- inch baking dish (or a shallow casserole dish of similar size) with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce (avoiding large chunks of meat). Place 3 of the noodles in the baking dish to create the first layer. Drop 1/3 cup of the ricotta mixture down the center of each noodle and level the domed mounds by pressing with the back of the measuring spoon. Sprinkle evenly with 1 1/3 cups of the mozzarella. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce evenly over the cheese. Repeat the layering of the noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and sauce two more times. Place the 3 remaining noodles on top of the sauce, then spread the remaining sauce over the noodles, sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/3 cups mozzarella, and then with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Planning Ahead: Assemble the casserole as directed in step 4 but do not bake. Wrap the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze, tightly wrapped with an additional layer of foil, for up to 2 months. If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours."

With the machine running, gradually add the molasses and milk; process until the dough is evenly moistened and forms a soft mass, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, with an electric mixer, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt at a low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and add the butter pieces; mix at medium-low speed until mixture is sandy and resembles fine meal, about 11/2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and, with the mixer running, gradually add the molasses and milk; mix until the dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase the speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds. Scrape the dough onto a work surface; divide it in half. Working with one portion at a time, roll the dough 1/4 inch thick between 2 large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving the dough sandwiched between the parchment layers, stack on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate the dough 2 hours or overnight). Adjust the oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray them with nonstick cooking spray.",
      "Remove 1 dough sheet from the freezer, place on the work surface. Peel off the top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip the dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut the dough into 5-inche gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread cookies, transferring shapes to prepared baking sheets with a wide metal spatula, spacing them 1 inch apart; set the scraps aside. Repeat with the remaining dough until the baking sheets are full. Bake the cookies until set in the centers and the dough barely retains an imprint when touched very gently with a fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes, rotating the baking sheets front to back and switching positions top to bottom halfway through the baking time. Do not overbake. Cool the cookies on the sheets 2 minutes, then remove the cookies with a wide metal spatula to a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Gather the scraps; repeat rolling, cutting, and baking in steps 2 and 4. Simple Icing: Start with 2 cups of powdered (aka confectioners or icing) sugar. Sift (not necessary but mixes more easily) powdered sugar with 1 tsp of vanilla. Slowly add cream or milk until a thick paste, a little runnier than peanut butter, forms. Spoon into a ziplock bag, and twist the open top to squeeze icing to one corner. Cut a small hole off of the corner. Continue to twist and squeeze from the top part of the bag."

Roast for about 20-30 minutes, stirring once partway through, or until they are crispy on the outside and cooked on the inside. (My batch of tiny sprouts only took about 12 minutes to cook.) Remove from oven and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, turning occasionally, until nearly-browned, about 6-8 minutes. Add the garlic, and continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the sausage is browned.",
      "Cook the pasta according to the package directions. (I begin heating my water while preparing the brussel sprouts, and added the pasta to the boiling water just after beginning to cook the sausage.) Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water (reserving 1/4 cup pasta water), and then toss together the pasta, pesto, cooked sausage and garlic, and brussels sprouts. Add in some of the reserved pasta water if needed for extra moisture.",

    "notes": [
      "If pancetta is too difficult to find, bacon may be substituted, though the flavor will not be quite the same. It should be sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. When purchasing dried beans, look for packages with whole, clean-looking beans; split beans and dust can be indicative of old age. Beans should be soaked for a minimum of eight hours and can be soaked for up to 24 hours (but for this length of time they should be stored in the refrigerator). Serve with a crusty loaf of bread or bruschetta and a leafy green salad.",
      "Planning Ahead: The stew may be prepared through step 1, then refrigerated for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 4 months. (Allow frozen stew to thaw completely in the refrigerator before reheating, to preserve the texture of the beans.) Bring the stew to a simmer over medium-low heat before continuing with step 2."

Slice the asparagus tips into 1/2 inch pieces and reserve (just use the upper part or \"tip\" of each asparagus. Take the remaining blanched asparagus and roughly chop and reserve. In a large soup of stock pot combine the whole butter with the diced yellow onion and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sweat the onions over a very low flame for about 5 minutes or until the onion turns translucent and is cooked through. Next add 1/2 cup of water and the 1/3 cup of flour to the onion and combine well. This step will create the base of the soup and will act as a \"thinking agent\". Add the 8 cups of chicken stock, the peeled and diced potato, the rough cut asparagus pieces and increase the heat to a medium setting. Cook for 45 minutes over a medium flame. Next add the heavy whipping cream and puree the soup. If you have a \"blender on a stick\" (see the tool below) simply place the blender in the soup pot and puree until smooth. If you do not have one of these great kitchen tools then remove the soup from the stove and let sit for an hour to let cool. Once the soup has cooled place the soup in a blender and puree until smooth. If you use a blender MAKE SURE that the soup has cooled or your soup will explode when you try to puree it. Once the soup has been pureed return to the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Take a break from all this work and have some fun. Taste the soup and adjust the seasonings if needed with salt and pepper. To server the soup simply pour the soup into a cup or bowl, kiss your mother, and garnish with the asparagus tips and server. Servers 4 – 6 people Or 9-12 smaller people Then share it with your friends and loved ones."

Place roll on cookie sheet with the narrow end tucked underneath the roll (this keeps the roll from coming undone while it's rising), shaping into crescent shape. Beat one egg in a cup, and brush rolls with the egg. Sprinkle poppy seeds over the roll. Let rolls rise 45 minutes in warm dishwasher. Bake rolls 10 minutes at 350°. Brush with melted butter.

      "Use the bread recipe for Rohlickes. When bread is rising, prepare filling for Kolaches. For apricot filling, use 1 package dried apricots & one package dried peaches. I usually chop the dried fruit in the food processor, then put in saucepan and cover with water, just barely. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, watching so they don't scorch. Add more water if needed. You want a kind of jam-like consistency for the filling. Stir in 1 cup sugar, taste, and add more if needed. Cool filling. After punching dough down, pinch dough off into 11/4 inch balls, put on greased cookie sheet. Make a depression in the center. Put in warm dishwasher to rise. After pan of rolls have risen about 30 minutes, go back and widen the depression with your fingers, so that a Tbsp of filling will fit in. Let the pan rise an additional 30 minutes. Fill the depression with filling, being careful not to get the filling all over the top of the bread. Make the crumb topping by mixing together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and about 2-3 Tbsp butter. Mix until crumbly, and put about a tsp on top of filling of each kolache, then bake for 9-11 minutes at 350°. Brush with melted butter. Makes 3 dozen. Julia Kastl"
